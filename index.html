  						<p class="prose">While the Summer Games allows greater leeway with respect to which city can host them, the Winter Olympics have more trickier requirements for temperature, snowfall, and elevation. </p>
  					</section>
            <section class="step">
              <p class="prose">The first Winter Games were hosted in Chamonix, France in 1924. </p>
            </section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<p class="prose">This year, the Olympics are hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The city has dubbed itself "Happy 700," a reference to its elevation above sea level, which a Korean tourism website claims is "ideal for the biorhythm of humans, animals, and plants." In 2014,  organizers of the Sochi Games had stockpiled snow from previous winters and purchased hundreds of snow cannons to account for its humid and subtropical climate. This year, Pyeongchang's climate is colder than Sochi's, but they have still needed to produce artificial snow. </p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<p class="prose"> In 2022, the Games are returning to Beijing, the host of the 2008 Summer Games. By beating Almaty, Kazakhstan by a mere four votes, Beijing will become the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Games. As a measure to minimize the exorbitant costs of the Games (Sochi cost around $50 billion, while Pyeongchang cost around $13 billion), Beijing plans to reuse some of the same venues from 2008. </p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<h2> This is where all the olympics have been hosted</h2>
  						<p class="prose">This is where all of the Olympics have been hosted. Lake Placid and St. Moritz have both hosted it twice. Because of the climate requirements for hosting the Winter Games, all hosts have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and these are the same countries that tend to do well at the Winter Games.</p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
	  						<p class="prose">Over the years, more and more countries have participated in the Winter Games. Tracking the countries that have participated in the Games is a lesson in international politics. </p>

  					<section class="step">
  						<p class="prose">As more countries participate, the number of athletes have also risen. </p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<h2>  there used to be almost no women </h2>
  						<p class="prose">However, there used to be almost no women. Female athletes were excluded from the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 because its founder, Pierre de Coubertin, felt their participation would be inappropriate. "No matter how toughened a sportswoman may be, her organism is not cut out to sustain certain shocks,"" the French educator and historianÂ said then. Now, they are slowly inching toward equal participation. </p>

              <h2>  more and more sports </h2>
              <p class="prose">Newer sports like freestyle skiing and snowboarding have been added to the programme to attract younger viewers.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step">
              <h2>  more and more events</h2>
              <p class="prose">This year, the mass start event has been added to speed skating, mixed doubles event to curling, big air event in snowboarding, and the mixed team event to alpine skiing. Mixed and team events allow athletes who might otherwise not have a chance to medal the opportunity to do so with a strong team. </p>
