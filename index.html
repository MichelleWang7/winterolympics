  						<p class="prose">While the Summer Games allows greater leeway with respect to which city can host them, the Winter Olympics have more trickier requirements for temperature, snowfall, and elevation. </p>
  					</section>
            <section class="step">
              <p class="prose">The first Winter Games were hosted in Chamonix, France in 1924. </p>
            </section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<p class="prose">This year, the Olympics are hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The city has dubbed itself "Happy 700," a reference to its elevation above sea level, which a Korean tourism website claims is "ideal for the biorhythm of humans, animals, and plants." In 2014,  organizers of the Sochi Games had stockpiled snow from previous winters and purchased hundreds of snow cannons to account for its humid and subtropical climate. This year, Pyeongchang's climate is colder than Sochi's, but they have still needed to produce artificial snow. </p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<p class="prose"> In 2022, the Games are returning to Beijing, the host of the 2008 Summer Games. By beating Almaty, Kazakhstan by a mere four votes, Beijing will become the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Games. As a measure to minimize the exorbitant costs of the Games (Sochi cost around $50 billion, while Pyeongchang cost around $13 billion), Beijing plans to reuse some of the same venues from 2008. </p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<h2> This is where all the olympics have been hosted</h2>
  						<p class="prose">This is where all of the Olympics have been hosted. Lake Placid and St. Moritz have both hosted it twice. Because of the climate requirements for hosting the Winter Games, all hosts have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and these are the same countries that tend to do well at the Winter Games.</p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
	  						<p class="prose">Over the years, more and more countries have participated in the Winter Games. Tracking the countries that have participated in the Games is a lesson in international politics. </p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<p class="prose">As more countries participate, the number of athletes have also risen. </p>
  					</section>
  					<section class="step">
  						<p class="prose">However, there used to be almost no women. Female athletes were not invited to the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 because Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), thought their participation would be unseemly. "No matter how toughened a sportswoman may be, her organism is not cut out to sustain certain shocks," the French educator and historianÂ said then. Now, women are slowly inching toward equal participation. Nordic combined remains the only sport in which men but not women compete.</p>

            <section class="step">
              <h2> New sports </h2>
              <p class="prose">All Winter Olympic sports must be practiced on snow or ice, and the IOC has added more modern sports like freestyle skiing and snowboarding to the programme to attract younger viewers.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                <h2> ...and newer events </h2>
              <p class="prose">This year, the mass start event has been added to speed skating, mixed doubles event to curling, big air event in snowboarding, and the mixed team event to alpine skiing. Mixed and team events allow athletes who might otherwise not have a chance to medal the opportunity to do so with a well-balanced team. </p>

              <h2>  How each country did at every Winter Games so far </h2>
             
            </div>
            <div id="smallmultiples"></div>
            
            <div class="stepp">
               <p class="prose">A total of 39 countries have won at least a single medal at the Winter Games. European countries tend to dominate the medal counts, but the U.S. and Canada have become stronger all-around challengers over the years, and smaller countries like the Netherlands and South Korea have begun to find their own niche. </p>
              <h2> Which countries dominate which sports? </h2>
            
            </div>
             <div id="matrix"></div>
            <div class="stepp">
                <p class="prose">Germany, Russia, and Norway are contenders in almost all sports, but specialize in a couple: Germany in sledding events like bobsled and luge, Russia in figure skating and biathlon, and Norway in all of the skiing events. The U.S. has scooped up most of the medals from the newer sports, including freestyle skiing and snowboarding. Clad in their traditional orange, the Netherlands has been a perennial force in speedskating. This year, South Korea will go wild for short-track, speedskating's quirkier and faster-paced sibling. Whereas speedskating is a race against the clock, short-track is a melee, with skaters going toe to toe, jostling for position.</p>
              <h2> Age </h2>
               <div id="age"></div>
              <p class="prose">Part of what makes the Olympics so gripping is that they reminds us of our own bodies. Watching the Olympics inspires a "How did he do that?" followed by a "Could <i>I</i> do that?" In the words of David Foster Wallace, "great athletes seem to catalyze our awareness of how glorious it is to touch and perceive, move through space, and interact with matter." Yet as we age, although that same glory he writes about never wavers, our physical capacities diminish, and we become unable to bridge the gap between our "physical wills and our actual capacities." And so every two years, we continue to tune in to the Olympics with a sense of wonder, because they give us a canvas onto which we project our own bodies, allowing us to experience the vicarious thrill that we, too, possess bodies that may go faster, fly higher, and push harder. </p>
